  - Be objective and consistent in your evaluations

  When Evaluating Single Variant:
  - Compare against the original PDF
  - Assess if improvements were successfully implemented
  - Identify remaining issues that need fixing
  - Provide specific, actionable feedback
  </evaluation_principles>

  <output_requirements>

    - Score 0.0-1.0 based on space optimization

    ## Visual Consistency (25%)
    - Is font sizing uniform across similar elements?
    - Are formatting styles consistent within sections?
    - Is hierarchy clear and well-defined?
    - Score 0.0-1.0 based on visual uniformity

    ## Readability (25%)
    - Can information be quickly scanned and found?
    - Are labels concise without redundancy?
    - Is the document easy to navigate?
    - Score 0.0-1.0 based on scannability

    ## Layout Quality (15%)
    - Are margins and alignment proper?
    - Is the page layout balanced?
    - Are page breaks appropriate?
    - Score 0.0-1.0 based on professional appearance
    </quality_framework>

    <thinking_process>
    Before providing your evaluation, systematically assess:

    1. **Goal Achievement**: Were the targeted visual issues successfully addressed?
    2. **Improvement Verification**: Compare original vs improved - what changed?
    3. **Quality Metrics**: Score each dimension objectively
    4. **Remaining Issues**: What problems still exist?
    5. **Overall Score**: Based on metrics, is this pass/needs_improvement/fail?
    6. **Actionable Feedback**: What specific improvements would help?
    </thinking_process>

    <evaluation_task>
    1. Compare the original and improved PDFs side-by-side
    2. Verify that targeted improvements were implemented
    3. Score each quality dimension (0.0 to 1.0)
    4. Identify any remaining visual issues
    5. Determine overall quality score (pass/needs_improvement/fail)
    6. Provide specific, actionable feedback for next iteration (if needed)
    </evaluation_task>

    <output_format>
    Provide structured evaluation:
    - score: "pass" or "needs_improvement" or "fail"
    - quality_metrics: {{spacing: 0.X, consistency: 0.X, readability: 0.X, layout: 0.X}}
    - feedback: Specific suggestions for improvements (if score is not "pass")

    Examples of good feedback:
    - "Spacing improved but still has large gaps in Experience section - reduce further"
    - "Font consistency achieved but labels could be more concise"
    - "Good progress on layout but page break still awkward in Education section"
    </output_format>

  multi_variant: |
    Compare {num_variants} CV style variants and select the best one based on visual quality criteria.

    <variants_to_compare>

    <improvement_context>
    Iteration: {iteration_number}
    Targeted Issues:
    {improvement_goals}
    </improvement_context>

    <quality_framework>
    Evaluate each variant across four dimensions:

    ## Spacing Efficiency (35%)
    - Vertical space utilization and optimization
    - Spacing consistency between sections/items
    - Balance between compactness and readability
    - **Compare**: Which variant makes best use of space?

    ## Visual Consistency (25%)
    - Font sizing uniformity across content
    - Formatting style consistency within sections
    - Hierarchy clarity and structure
    - **Compare**: Which variant is most visually consistent?

    ## Readability (25%)
    - Information scannability and findability
    - Label conciseness without redundancy
    - Document navigation ease
    - **Compare**: Which variant is easiest to read/scan?

    ## Layout Quality (15%)
    - Margins, alignment, and balance
    - Page break placement
    - Professional appearance
    - **Compare**: Which variant looks most professional?
    </quality_framework>

    <comparison_framework>
    For each variant, systematically assess:

    1. **Individual Scoring**: Score each variant on all four dimensions (0.0-1.0)
    2. **Relative Comparison**: How do variants differ on each dimension?
    3. **Trade-off Analysis**: Does any variant excel in one area but lack in another?
    4. **Balanced Selection**: Which variant best balances all criteria?
    5. **Improvement Verification**: Did all variants address the targeted issues?
    6. **Overall Winner**: Which variant has the highest weighted score?
    </comparison_framework>

    <thinking_process>
    Before selecting the best variant, systematically consider:

    1. **Individual Assessment**: Score each variant independently
       - Variant 1: spacing, consistency, readability, layout scores
       - Variant 2: spacing, consistency, readability, layout scores
       - Variant N: spacing, consistency, readability, layout scores

    2. **Comparative Analysis**: Identify key differences
       - Which variant has best spacing optimization?
       - Which has most consistent formatting?
       - Which is most readable/scannable?
       - Which has best overall layout?

    3. **Trade-off Identification**: Understand compromises
       - Does aggressive spacing reduction hurt readability?
       - Does conservative approach waste space unnecessarily?
       - Is the balanced approach truly optimal?

    4. **Weighted Scoring**: Apply weights to calculate overall score
       - Spacing (35%) + Consistency (25%) + Readability (25%) + Layout (15%)
       - Which variant has highest weighted score?

    5. **Quality Assessment**: Determine if best variant meets standards
       - All metrics >= 0.7 → "pass"
       - Most metrics 0.5-0.7 → "needs_improvement"
       - Multiple metrics < 0.5 → "fail"

    6. **Feedback Generation**: Provide actionable suggestions
       - What could improve in next iteration?
       - Which specific issues remain?
       - What's the priority for iteration N+1?
    </thinking_process>

    <evaluation_task>
    1. Examine all {num_variants} variants against the original
    2. Score each variant on all four quality dimensions
    3. Compare variants to identify strengths and weaknesses
    4. Select the variant with best overall balance
    5. Assess if the best variant meets quality standards
    6. Provide feedback for next iteration (if needed)
    </evaluation_task>

    <output_format>
    Provide structured comparison results:
    - best_variant_id: ID of selected variant
    - score: "pass" or "needs_improvement" or "fail" (for best variant)
    - quality_metrics: Scores for the best variant
    - all_variant_scores: Detailed scores for all variants
    - comparison_summary: Explanation of selection with trade-offs

    Example comparison_summary:
    "Selected Variant 2 as it achieves the best balance across all criteria. While Variant 1 had slightly better spacing optimization (0.85 vs 0.82), Variant 2 excelled in consistency (0.88 vs 0.75) and readability (0.85 vs 0.78), resulting in a higher weighted score. Variant 3's aggressive spacing reduction compromised readability too much (0.62). The main remaining issue is [specific issue], which should be addressed in the next iteration."

    Example feedback:
    - "Good progress on spacing - now focus on label redundancy in Technical Skills section"
    - "Variant achieves consistency but page break in Experience section needs fixing"
    - "Excellent improvements across all dimensions - ready for use"
    </output_format>
