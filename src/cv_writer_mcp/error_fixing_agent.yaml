  5. Apply all the necessary minimal syntax fixes to the LaTeX file content
  6. Return the corrected LaTeX file content with all fixes applied
  </PROCESS>

  <RULES>
  - Fix only structural syntax issues
  - Preserve all original content and formatting

  Fix the following LaTeX compilation errors by analyzing the line-numbered content:

  {latex_error_guide}

  <LATEX_FILE_CONTENT_WITH_LINE_NUMBERS>
  {numbered_latex_content}
  </LATEX_FILE_CONTENT_WITH_LINE_NUMBERS>

  <ERROR_ANALYSIS>
  Target File: {tex_file_path}
  Total Errors Found: {error_count}
  Warnings: {warning_count}
  Log Status: {validation_status}
  Line-Specific Errors Found: {line_specific_errors_count}
  </ERROR_ANALYSIS>
  {focused_errors_text}
  {critical_errors_text}
  <FULL_LOG_EXCERPT>
  {log_content}
  </FULL_LOG_EXCERPT>

  CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
  1. The content above shows LINE NUMBERS (e.g., "045: content")
  2. When log shows "l.45 \\end{{itemize}}}}", look at line 045 in the numbered content
  3. Fix the exact issues at those specific lines and surrounding context
  4. IMPORTANT: Return your corrected content WITH the same line number format
  5. Do not remove the line numbers - I will process them after
  6. Focus on brace matching, environment nesting, and command syntax
  7. Pay special attention to the problematic lines identified in the error guide

  Return the corrected content maintaining the "XXX: content" line number format.
