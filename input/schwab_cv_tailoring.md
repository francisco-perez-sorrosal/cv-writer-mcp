Advised early-stage startups including Wasmer on AI integration patterns, strategy, and production deployment requirements.

Ensured state-of-the-art adoption of Agentic AI practices across product development cycles.

Principal Research Engineer – Knowledge Graph Science @ Yahoo (2023–2024)

Entity Reconciliation: Fine-tuned transformer-based models on heterogeneous datasets to improve entity linking. Achieved precision/recall improvements of 22%+ in people categories and 16%+ in creative works.

Dataset Quality Enhancement: Designed an LLM-based validation pipeline for semi-supervised labels, substantially increasing dataset reliability.

Pipeline Innovation: Reduced production model maintenance from ~30 heterogeneous models to 4 unified LLM-powered systems, improving scalability and lowering costs.

Deployment: Implemented cloud-based inference with Ray Serve, balancing CPU/GPU cost-efficiency.

Principal Research Engineer – Yahoo Mail (2022)

Designed knowledge distillation frameworks for mail classification: created teacher-student models that increased taxonomy coverage while boosting accuracy by 3–6%.

Delivered real-time (low-latency) and offline (high-accuracy) models for enterprise deployment at scale.

Principal Research Engineer – Yahoo Ads (2021–2022)

Built a multilingual contextual targeting model using hierarchical multi-label classification for web categorization.

Work resulted in an ACM SIGKDD 2022 publication with growing citations.

Principal Research Engineer – Verizon Media Science & Content Platform (2018–2021)

Developed deep learning pipelines with Hugging Face Transformers, achieving +10% improvements over legacy systems.

Proposed and implemented few-shot classification methods leveraging prefix conditioning for transformers, improving zero-shot category expansion.

Authored ACL 2019 paper (127 citations) on hierarchical transfer learning for text classification.

Earlier Roles (2012–2017)

Content Ingestion Platform, Yahoo Labs: Architected pipelines for large-scale ingestion and classification. Created K8s-based scaling workflows for ML pipelines.
