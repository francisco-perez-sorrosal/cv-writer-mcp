Abstract
The moderncv package provides a document class for typesetting modern curriculum vitæ
and cover letters in various styles. Five predefined styles are available, each of which can be
adjusted through various options for headings, footers and colors. It is fairly customizable,
allowing the user to adjust the look and feel of each style to their liking. Several macros allow
the user to add content to the CV and format it in a consistent way. A letter of motivation
consistent with the style is part of the template as well.

1 Getting started
1.1 How to read this manual
This manual is organized as follows. The current section explains on how to get started with the
moderncv package, i.e. how to install required packages. Section 2 explains how to work with the
moderncv template file step by step. Section 3 details the customizations that the user can make:
the different styles, their options, colors and tips and tricks. Section 4 details the packages that
moderncv uses, known problems and possible solutions to those problems.
1.2 Installation instructions
If the moderncv package does not ship with your LATEX distribution or if the installed version is
too old, grab the moderncv code from CTAN or GitHub:
https://ctan.org/pkg/moderncv
https://github.com/moderncv/moderncv
Note. Depending on your LATEX distribution, you may have to install some additional packages.
Section 4.2 lists all the packages that moderncv requires to be installed on your system.
2 The moderncv template step by step
This section is a quick reference to the moderncv package and should contain enough information
to typeset a first working CV. The easiest way to get started with moderncv is to use the template
that comes with the package. If moderncv is part of your LATEX distribution, search for the folder
moderncv on your system, which should contain all the files for the package. In this folder, there
should be a file called template.tex. If you downloaded the package from GitHub or CTAN,
look for template.tex in the folder of the newly downloaded (and possibly extracted) package.
Note. If you downloaded moderncv from GitHub or CTAN and moved template.tex to another
folder, make sure to adjust the TEXINPUTS variable to find the newly downloaded package. Otherwise, either the package version provided by your LATEX distribution gets used or LATEX throws an
error if there is no other version installed.
Test your setup by compiling template.tex and looking at the result.
Note. The moderncv package should compile with pdflatex, lualatex and xelatex. However,
not all icons are available when using pdflatex, so using either lualatex or xelatex is highly
recommended.

2.1 Basic setup
A document using the moderncv document class is set up like any other document class. We will
go through the template step by step.
Configuring document class options
The moderncv document class is loaded as per usual, by
\documentclass[<options >]{moderncv}
where at most one value for each option can be passed to the document class:
paper: a4paper (default), a5paper, b5paper, letterpaper,
legalpaper, executivepaper, landscape
font family: sans, roman
font size: 10pt, 11pt (default), 12pt
draft/final: draft, final (default)
Choosing a moderncv style and color
Choose a moderncv style and color by adjusting the commands
\moderncvstyle{<style >}
\moderncvcolor{<color >}
As explained in template.tex, the possible values are
style: casual (default), classic, banking, oldstyle, fancy
color: black , blue (default), burgundy , green ,
grey , orange , purple , red
Note. Some of the styles take additional options to fine-tune their appearance. To keep this
overview short, these options will be described in section 3.1.
Font family and page numbering
The default font family is set by the line \renewcommand{\familydefault}{\sfdefault} in
template.tex. Use \sfdefault for the default sans-serif font, \rmdefault for the default roman
font, and likewise for any TEX font name. The general syntax is
\renewcommand{\familydefault}{< fontfamily >}
% \nopagenumbers{}
Uncommenting %\nopagenumbers{} suppresses automatic page numbering for CVs longer than
one page.
Adjusting input encoding
If you are not using xelatex or lualatex, which both use utf8 encoding by default, uncomment
the \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} import and change the encoding as needed.
2.1.1 Language-specific setup
The babel package can be loaded in the preamble of your CV.
3
Note. moderncv doesn’t work with babel in Spanish (see this GitHub issue).
For CJK users, uncomment the \usepackage{CJKutf8} import.
2.2 Personal data
Edit the personal data section to reflect your personal information. This data will appear in the
header of the first page of the CV and/or in the footer of every page, as well as on the cover letter.
Most of the commands are optional, so try out what you like and see what you need.
\name A command for your name. Takes the given name and surname as arguments.
\name{<given name >}{< surname >}
\title A command for a document title. Could be used for a generic CV title, job title, etc.
\title{<title >}
\born A command for a birth date.
\born{<birth date >}
\address A command for a three-lined street address.
\address{<street address >}{< city and postcode >}{< country >}
\phone A command for a phone number. Takes the phone type as an optional argument.
\phone[<type >]{<phone number >}
The allowed values for <type> are fax, fixed and mobile.
\email A command for an email address.
\email{<email address >}
\homepage A command for a personal website.
\homepage{<web address >}
\social A command for a social media account. Takes the platform as an optional argument.
\social[<platform >]{< username or handle >}
The following values are supported for <platform>:
• arxiv
• battlenet
• bitbucket
• codeberg
• discord
• github
• gitlab
• googlescholar
• inspire
• instagram
• linkedin
• mastodon
• matrix
• orcid
• playstation
• researcherid
• researchgate
• signal
• skype
• soundcloud
4
• stackoverflow
• steam
• telegram
• tiktok
• twitch
• twitter
• whatsapp
• xbox
• xing
• youtube
\extrainfo A command for any extra information.
\extrainfo{<extra information >}
\photo A command for a photo. Takes the image file name as a required argument. Takes the
height of the photo and the thickness of the photo frame as optional arguments.
\photo[<photo height >][< frame thickness >]{<photo file name >}
\quote A command for a quote.
\quote{<quote >}
Note. Long names and URLs can break some CVs and cover letters depending on the used style.
Manually inserting line breaks for names with \\ can help for oldstyle or fancy. Adjusting
lengths as described in section 3.4 could help to mitigate issues with long URLs.
Pictures. For some occasions you may need to include pictures besides the portrait photo. For
this task it is helpful to know basic lengths used in moderncv. For a more detailed description of
lengths see section 3.4. For instance, pictures can be included with \includegraphics:
\hspace{\ hintscolumnwidth + \ separatorcolumnwidth }\ includegraphics
[<scale >]{< file name picture >}
Adding \hspace in units of basic moderncv lengths will fit them more naturally into the CV or
resume.
Bibliography. In case BibTeX is used, the bibliography settings are adjusted in the lines
% to show numerical labels in the bibliography (default is to show
no labels)
% \renewcommand*{\bibliographyitemlabel }{[\arabic{enumiv}]}
% \renewcommand{\refname}{Articles}
% bibliography with mutiple entries
% \usepackage{multibib}
% \newcites{book , misc}{{Books}, {Others}}
By default, no labels are shown for bibliography entries. Uncommenting the line %\renewcommand
*{\bibliographyitemlabel}{[\arabic{enumiv}]} allows one to fine-tune the labels. Uncommenting the line %\renewcommand{\refname}{Articles} allows one to redefine the bibliography
heading string “Publications” that is shown by default. Finally, adjustments using the multibib
package can be done in the last two lines shown here.
Note. BibLaTeX is currently not supported.

2.3 Modifying CV content
2.3.1 Structuring the CV
As with any other document style, the CV can be structured into sections and subsections using
\section and \subsection.
The moderncv package provides some macros to add content to your CV. The easiest way to
understand their intended use is to look at how they’re used in the template. Nonetheless, we list
the macros here along with a short description of their intended use.
2.3.2 General macros
\cvitem A flexible command for a single CV entry. Takes the descriptor and body text as
required arguments. Can be used to list job experiences and similar.
\cvitem{<descriptor >}{<body >}
\cvdoubleitem A two-column variation of \cvitem. Takes four required arguments: the descriptor and body text of the first column and the descriptor and body text of the second column.
Can be used to enter skills, such as computer skills or language skills, in a two-column fashion.
\cvdoubleitem{< descriptor 1>}{< body 1>}{< descriptor 2>}{< body 2>}
\cvtripleitem A three-column variation of \cvitem. Takes six required arguments: the descriptor and body text of the first column, second and third column. Can be used to enter skills,
such as computer skills or language skills, in a three-column fashion.
\cvtripleitem{< descriptor 1>}{< body 1>}{< descriptor 2>}{< body 2>}{<
descriptor 3>}{< body 3>}
\cvitemwithcomment A variation of \cvitem with an additional argument for a comment. Can
be used to enter skills such as computer skills or language skills.
\cvitemwithcomment{<descriptor >}{< skill level >}{< comment >}
\cventry A command for entering an education or job experience. Takes six required arguments:
date(s), degree/job title, educational institution/employer, city, academic grade and description.
While arguments 3 to 6 aren’t optional, they can be left empty. If line breaks in argument 6 aren’t
done properly, a minipage can be used. Alternatively, \newline{} can be used to break lines in
argument 6.
\cventry{<year --year >}{< degree/job title >}{< institution /employer >}
{<city >}{<grade >}{< description >}
\cvlistitem A command for a single bullet-list item. Very long lines get broken.
\cvlistitem{<item >}
\cvlistdoubleitem A two-column variation of \cvlistitem.
\cvlistdoubleitem{<item 1>}{ item 2>}
6
\cvcolumns An environment typesetting multicolumn \cvitems. This can be combined with
the itemize environment.
\begin{cvcolumns}
\cvcolumn {<category 1>}{< content >}
\cvcolumn {<category 2>}{< content >}
\cvcolumn [<width >]{< content >}
\end{cvcolumns}
<width> is a number between 0 and 1 controling the width of the column.
2.3.3 Skill matrix macros
The skill matrix is a table for displaying skills such as computer skills or project management
skills graphically. The skill matrix table consists of several elements:
• the graphical representation of the skill on a scale from 0 to 5,
• the legend to explain the meaning of the scale,
• a header line to explain the meaning of the table columns and
• the actual skill entries.
\cvskill A command for the graphical representation of a single skill. The required argument
must be a number from 0 to 5.
\cvskill{<0-5>}
This command can be used outside of the skill matrix, too.
\cvskilllegend A command for a legend for the skill matrix. Takes six optional arguments:
post-padding width and the descriptions for the five skill levels.
\cvskilllegend
\cvskilllegend*[<post -padding >][< level 1>][< level 2>][< level 3>]
[<level 4>][< level 5>]{< descriptor >}
The command with no arguments inserts the legend in its standard form: without a descriptor or
any lines. An optional asterisk toggles the inclusion of a dashed line. <post-padding> must be a
valid length like 1em or 1ex.
The most general form of this command can be used to translate the legend descriptions into
other languages or to add a name descriptor:
% Example: German translation
\cvskilllegend[0.2 em][ Grundkenntnisse ]
[ Grundkenntnisse und eigene Erfahrung in Projekten ]
[ Umfangreiche Erfahrung in Projekten ]
[ Vertiefte Expertenkenntnisse ][ Experte/Guru ]{ Legende}
\cvskillplainlegend A variation of \cvskilllegend with the first three skill levels in the
first column.
\cvskillplainlegend
\cvskillplainlegend*[<post -padding >][< level 1>][< level 2>]
[<level 3>][< level 4>][< level 5>]{< descriptor >}
7
\cvskillhead A command for a header line for the skill matrix. Takes five optional arguments:
post-padding width, level, skill label, years of experience and a comment.
\cvskillhead[<post -padding >][<level >][<skill >][< years of experience
>][< comment >]
<post-padding> must be a valid length like 1em or 1ex.
\cvskillentry A command for an entry in the skill matrix. Takes five required arguments:
skill category, skill level (0 to 5), skill name, years of experience and a comment. Takes a single
optional argument for the post-padding width.
\cvskillentry*[<post -padding >]{< skill category >}{<0-5>}
{<skill name >}{< years of experience >}{< comment >}
An optional asterisk toggles the inclusion of a dashed line. <post-padding> must be a valid
length like 1em or 1ex.
How to make length adjustments to the skill matrix will be explained in section 3.4.1.
2.4 Letter of motivation
In order to provide additional information for a job application, moderncv provides a motivation
letter. Define the following recipient data fields to customize your letter:
\recipient A command for the letter’s recipient. This allows line breaks to properly format
the recipient’s address.
\recipient{<Team or contact person >}{< company >\\< street >\\<city >}
\date A command to set the letter’s date.
\date{<your custom date >}
\subject A command to define the job application subject.
\subject{<subject >}
\opening A command to set your opening (e.g. “Dear X,” or “To whom it may concern,”).
\opening{<greeting >}
\closing A command to set your closing (e.g. “Sincerely,” or “Yours truly,”).
\closing{<closing >}
\signature An optional command to include your signature after the closing. This feature is
defined using the \includegraphics. The first argument is the scale and the second argument is
the filename of your scanned signature.
\signature{<scale >}{<signature filename >}
8
\enclosure A command to list the attached documents. The first optional parameter allows a
redefinition of the default “Enclosure” label.
\enclosure[<optional alternative label >]{< list of documents >}
Note. If typesetting the resume in Chinese using CJK an additional \clearpage is required after
the \makeletterclosing command. This helps fancyhdr to work correctly with CJK. Otherwise
it will remove the page numbering by making lastpage undefined.
3 Customization
3.1 Styles and their options
Each style allows fine-tuning via options passed into the \moderncvstyle command:
\moderncvstyle[<option 1>, <option 2>, ...]{ < style >}
Each style defines its own options, and not all options are available for each style. Below is a list
of all the options available for each style:
casual This style allows the following options which only affect header and footer styles:
head alignment values: left, right (default). Aligns the title and the picture if one is
included.
name values: alternate. Displays the name in all lowercase. Differentiation
of the name is done by color (disabled by default). This feature is
discouraged for longer names.
data in head values: details, nodetails (default). Toggles between the header
and footer as the location of personal data on the page.
symbols values: symbols (default), nosymbols. Toggles between inclusion of
icons or text-based abbreviations for personal data.
classic This style allows the following options which only affect header and footer styles:
alignment values: left (default), right. Aligns the address block and the picture.
data in head values: details, nodetails (default). Toggles between the header and
footer as the location of personal data on the page.
symbols values: symbols (default), nosymbols. Toggles between inclusion of icons
or text-based abbreviations for personal data.
banking This style allows the following options:
alignment (body) values: left (default), center, right. Aligns the entries in the
style.
rule style values: fullrules, shortrules, mixedrules (default), norules.
Adjusts the rules used in the style.
data in head values: details, nodetails (default). Toggles between the header
and footer as the location of personal data on the page.
symbols values: symbols (default), nosymbols. Toggles between inclusion
of icons or text-based abbreviations for personal data.
9
oldstyle This style allows the following options:
data in head values: details, nodetails (default). Toggles between the header and
footer as the location of personal data on the page.
symbols values: symbols (default), nosymbols. Toggles between inclusion of
icons or text-based abbreviations for personal data.
fancy This style allows the following options:
data in head values: details, nodetails (default). Toggles between the header and
footer as the location of personal data on the page.
symbols values: symbols (default), nosymbols. Toggles between inclusion of
icons or text-based abbreviations for personal data.
Note. Only one option from each option category can be passed in at a time, e.g.
\moderncvstyle[left , nosymbols ]{ casual}
contemporary This style allows the following options which only affect header and footer
styles:
alignment values: left (default), right. Aligns the address block and the picture.
data in head values: details (default), nodetails. Toggles between the header and
footer as the location of personal data on the page.
qr values: qr (default), noqr. Enables or disables the inclusion of a QR code
of your personal website.
Note. For the contemporary style it is recommended to use the \moderncvcolor{cerulean}
color scheme. The contemporary style is even more appealing with reduced margins. Use this in
your preamble:
\usepackage[hmargin =0.5in ,vmargin =10 pt]{ geometry}
3.2 Adjusting colors
The colors of each style can be adjusted.
Note. The color theme must be loaded before \moderncvstyle, i.e.
\moderncvcolor{blue}
\moderncvstyle{casual}
Base colors. Each style defines three main colors: color0, color1 and color2. color0 is
black and the main text color. color1 is the main theme color, like blue, green, etc. color2 is
a some form of grey used for the user data, etc. These colors can be redefined by using either
\definecolor or \colorlet:
\definecolor{color 1}{ rgb }{0.55 , 0.55 , 0.55} % dark grey
\colorlet{color 1}{ black}
Any mechanism for naming and defining colors used by the xcolor package can be used to
redefine the colors of a moderncv style.
10
Fine tuning. If an even finer control over the color scheme of the style is desired, the following
color settings are used internally for the casual style and can be redefined:
% Head and footer
\colorlet{ lastnamecolor }{ color 1}
\colorlet{ namecolor }{ lastnamecolor }
\colorlet{ headrulecolor }{ color 1}
\colorlet{ firstnamecolor }{ lastnamecolor !50}
\colorlet{ titlecolor }{ color 2}
\colorlet{ addresscolor }{ color 2}
\colorlet{ quotecolor }{ color 1}
\colorlet{ pictureframecolor }{ color 1}
% Body
\colorlet{ bodyrulecolor }{ color 1}
\colorlet{ sectioncolor }{ color 1}
\colorlet{ subsectioncolor }{ color 1}
\colorlet{ hintstylecolor }{ color 0}
% Letter
\colorlet{ letterclosingcolor }{ color 2}
% Skill matrix
\colorlet{ skillmatrixfullcolor }{ color 1}
\colorlet{ skillmatrixemptycolor }{ color 2!30}
3.3 Modifying symbols and icons
3.3.1 Icons
As stated in section 3.1, the use of icons is toggled by the symbols option that can be passed to
\moderncvstyle.
The icons used in the display of the personal data (phone numbers, email, fax, social media
accounts, etc.) can be customized by redefining the internal commands for the symbols:
\renewcommand*{<\ symbolcommand >}{{\small <\symbol >}~}
Using \small is optional, but the default behavior is to render all icons using \small. Use \small
if one merely wishes to replace an icon/symbol while keeping the size consistent with the default
icons/symbols. The tilde ensures proper spacing after the symbols and is recommended as well.
Currently moderncv supports the following commands as <\symbolcommand>:
• \addresssymbol
• \mobilephonesymbol
• \fixedphonesymbol
• \faxphonesymbol
• \emailsymbol
• \homepagesymbol
• \linkedinsocialsymbol
• \xingsocialsymbol
• \twittersocialsymbol
• \githubsocialsymbol
• \gitlabsocialsymbol
• \stackoverflowsocialsymbol
• \googlescholarsocialsymbol
• \telegramsocialsymbol
• \whatsappsocialsymbol
• \signalsocialsymbol
• \matrixsocialsymbol
• \orcidsocialsymbol
• \researchgatesocialsymbol
• \researcheridsocialsymbol
11
• \bitbucketsocialsymbol
• \skypesocialsymbol
• \bornsymbol
• \arxivsocialsymbol
• \inspiresocialsymbol
The possible options for <\symbol> depend on the package that is used. By default, the marvosym
package is loaded if pdflatex is used, and the academicons and fontawesome5 packages are
loaded if either lualatex or xelatex is used. Full lists of all available symbols and icons can be
found in the documentation of each respective package:
https://ctan.org/pkg/marvosym
https://ctan.org/pkg/fontawesome5
https://ctan.org/pkg/academicons
Example. If one wanted to use the dingbat fonts to replace the default phone symbol, one
should load the pifont package in the preamble and then substitute the default symbol with the
dingbat symbol ✆ with
\renewcommand*{\fixedphonesymbol}{\ ding {38}~}
Alternative to icons In case you do not want symbols (default) for the icons, there is also the
option to replace icons with letters instead. This is set by the macro \moderncvicons, which
must be called after setting the style in the preamble.
\ moderncvicons {<symbols|letters >}
This mechanism is also used to determine the icon set. In principle the \moderncvicons can be
used to determine the icon set with the possible values marvosym, awesome or academic, but
it is recommended to let moderncv decide the correct icon set due to differing LATEX compiler
support.
3.3.2 Listing labels
The labels used in itemize environments, cvlistitem and cvlistdoubleitem can be changed
in two different ways:
• Redefining \labelitemi, \labelitemii, \labelitemiii and \labelitemiv changes the
labels for itemize environments as well as for cvlistitem and cvlistdoubleitem, e.g.
\renewcommand{\ labelitemi }{-}
• Redefining \listitemsymbol changes the labels for cvlistitem and cvlistdoubleitem
but not for itemize environments, e.g.
\renewcommand{\ listitemsymbol }{-}
3.4 Adjusting lengths
Some lengths in moderncv can be adjusted.
The hints column can be adjusted by setting \hintscolumnwidth:
\setlength{\ hintscolumnwidth }{3 cm}
12
For the classic style, the amount of horizontal space for the name can be adjusted by setting
\makecvheadnamewidth to avoid breaks:
\setlength{\ makecvheadnamewidth }{10 cm}
One should be careful though, as the length is normally calculated to avoid any overlap with the
personal information. This should be used at one’s own typographical risk.
The spacing between the hints column and the CV entries can be adjusted by setting
\separatorcolumnwidth. The default value is 0.025\textwidth.
\setlength{\ separatorcolumnwidth }{0.05\ textwidth}
The spacing between the list symbol and the text item of \cvlistitem and \cvlistdoubleitem
can be adjusted by setting \listitemsymbolspace in the preamble. The default value is set to
0pt.
\setlength{\ listitemsymbolspace }{5 pt}
The width of the footer can be adjusted by setting \footwidth. Due to internal calculations
\renewcommand is needed. The default value is 0.8\textwidth.
\renewcommand*{\ recomputefootlengths }{%
\setlength{\ footwidth }{0.9\ textwidth}}
The width of the quote can be adjusted by setting \quotewidth. Due to internal calculations
\renewcommand is needed. The default value is 0.65\textwidth.
\renewcommand*{\ recomputecvheadlengths }{%
\setlength{\ quotewidth }{0.5\ textwidth}}
3.4.1 Lengths in the skill matrix
Both the width of the skill matrix legend and the width of the skill matrix columns can be adjusted.
The width of the skill matrix legend can be adjusted as follows:
\ setcvskilllegendcolumns [<width >][< factor >]
% Examples:
\ setcvskilllegendcolumns [][0.45]
\ setcvskilllegendcolumns [\ widthof{‘‘Legend ’ ’}][0.45]
\ setcvskilllegendcolumns [0ex ][0.46] % useful for the banking style
<width> should be a length smaller than \textwidth, and <factor> must be between 0 and 1.
The width of the skill matrix columns can be adjusted as follows:
\ setcvskillcolumns [<width >][< factor >][< exp_width >]
% Examples:
\ setcvskillcolumns [5em ][][] % adjust first column , same as \
setcvskillcolumns[5em]
\ setcvskillcolumns [][0.45][] % adjust third (skill) column , same
as \setcvskillcolumns [][0.45]
\ setcvskillcolumns [][][\ widthof{‘‘Year ’’}] % adjust fourth (years
of experience) column
\ setcvskillcolumns [][0.45][\ widthof{‘‘Year ’’}]
\ setcvskillcolumns [\ widthof{‘‘Language ’ ’}][0.48][]
\ setcvskillcolumns [\ widthof{‘‘Language ’’}]
<width> and <exp_width> should be lengths smaller than \textwidth, and <factor> must be
between 0 and 1.

3.5 Additional link commands
To create links to a website or a email address, use the following commands:
A general weblink with optional text.
\link[<text >]{<link >}
%% example

3.6 Page breaks and orphaned section headers
If LATEX breaks pages just after \section or \subsection commands, try adjusting the stretchability of the page with \cvsectionstretchability or \cvsubsectionstretchability:
\setlength{\ cvsectionstretchability }{\baselineskip}
\setlength{\ cvsubsectionstretchability }{100 pt}
These two lengths tell LATEX how much extra length it needs after \section and \subsection
commands. By default, moderncv sets both lengths to 0.9\baselineskip.
This should solve orphaned \section and \subsection commands that are used alone for most
users. However, LATEX does not check for content. For example, writing
\section{blub}
\subsection{blubblub }
one after the other may cause LATEX to place the section and subsection headers on separate pages.
Since LATEX considers the subsection header to not be orphaned, it may place the section header
at the bottom of a page if there is enough space to do so while placing the subsection header
on the next page. One solution is to increase \cvsectionstretchability to force the break of
the section header. However, this changes the behaviour for all \section commands in your CV
and might cause unnecessary page breaks. It is therefore recommended to force the page break
manually with a \newpage in this case.

Experts only: Internally, moderncv uses a custom \needspace command:
\NewDocumentCommand\ @cvneedspace {m}{%
\begingroup
\setlength{\ dimen@ }{#1}%
\vskip\z@\@plus\dimen@
\penalty \ withinstretchpenalty \vskip\z@\@plus -\dimen@
\vskip\dimen@
\penalty \ poststretchpenalty%
\vskip -\dimen@
\vskip\z@skip % hide the previous |\vskip| from |\addvspace|
\endgroup
}
Thus, instead of setting \cvsectionstretchability and/or \cvsubsectionstretchability,
page break behavior can be adjusted by redefining the following internal penalties:
\renewcommand{\ withinstretchpenalty }{ < -100...9999 >}
\renewcommand{\ poststretchpenalty }{ < -100...9999 >}.
By default, moderncv sets \withinstretchpenalty to 0 and \poststretchpenalty to 9999.
The higher the penalties are, the less likely a page break will occur. A good explanation
of \needspace can be found at https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/348994/

3.7 Tips and Tricks
3.7.1 Legal disclaimer at the end of the CV
Some countries (e.g. Italy) require you to add a legal disclaimer authorizing the use of the personal
data in your CV. To add such a disclaimer, add the following to the bottom of your CV:1
\vfill
\begin{center}
\textit{\small Ai sensi del D. Lgs. 196/2003 ...}
\end{center}
4 Implementation details
4.1 Creating your own styles
Currently moderncv ships with six different styles: casual (default), classic, banking, oldstyle,
fancy and contemporary. Internally, these styles are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively.
All styles except oldstyle and fancy possess additional option parameters which were described in section 3.1.
Different styles’ head, body and foot can be combined to create custom styles. This is done by
setting \moderncvhead, \moderncvbody and \moderncvfoot in the preamble. Here is an example
of a custom style with a banking head, an oldstyle body and a casual foot:
\ moderncvhead {3}
\ moderncvbody {4}
\ moderncvfoot {1}

Furthermore, options for each part of moderncv parts can be set as well in such combinations. To
get a CV with a classic head and a banking body with full rules, define the following in the
preamble:
\ moderncvhead {2}
\ moderncvbody [ fullrules ]{3}
\ moderncvfoot {1}
4.2 Required packages
In addition to the packages that moderncv provides, the following packages are loaded internally:
• etoolbox
• ifthen
• xcolor
• ifxetex or ifluatex
• fontenc
• url
• hyperref
• graphicx
• fancyhdr
• tweaklist2
• calc
• xparse
• microtype
• expl3
• tikz
• changepage
• fontawesome5
• academicons
• tgpagella
• ebgaramond
• kurier
• multirow
• arydshln
Most of these packages should be included in your LATEX distribution of choice.
4.3 Known conflicts with other packages
1. moderncv is incompatible with biber.
2. moderncv is incompatible with BibLaTeX.
3. moderncv is incompatible with babel in Spanish
4.4 Known bugs
1. Skill matrices don’t break automatically in fancy style.
2. Long names break the oldstyle style and possibly other styles (needs testing).
3. Long URLs in classic style can make the name break line. Fixed width for the address
part must be implemented.
4. When using the fancy style, undesired space is added between the bibliography head and
the first entry, as well as after the last entry.
5. Footnotes generate errors, but the output seems correct when running with -interaction=
nonstopmode.
6. When using CJK, the last \clearpage required for the fancyhdr package to work properly
kills the “lastpage” counter, and therefore also the page numbering.
2The tweaklist package has been altered for the development of moderncv and ships with moderncv.

7. moderncv produces the error “lonely \item--perhaps a missing list environment”
when used with the bibentry package, though the output is actually correct. Among other
things, this causes compilation by LyX to stop.
8. The space after a \cventry gets eaten up when the last argument contains a nested itemize
environment. An ugly hack and incomplete solution was implemented by including a
\strut in every item label, but this doesn’t solve the problem for multi-line items. Ideally,
the \strut should end the item, but there seems to be no way to do this.
